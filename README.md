# Sick LED Driver

**Work in progress**

Six channel LED driver board that is (quite literally) built around the [LZ7-04-M2PD](https://www.osram.com/ecat/LED%20ENGIN%20LuxiGen%20LZ7-04M2PD/com/en/class_pim_web_catalog_103489/prd_pim_device_13582430/) on MCPCB from LED Engin.

 It's a 60W LED with six colours, which can be used to do some adjustable white experiments due to the relatively full spectrum of the LED (at least compared to a normal RGB-LED):

The project's objective is not to build an LED that is as bright as possible but to create a dev board that makes it easy to study RGBALC LEDs. Thus, the board is powered via USB-PD and programmed with Arduino.
